# ❓ AMA-SESSION #1

**Q: What is the goal of this game?**

_A: Create good enough buildings that will generate enough resources for you to take part in pvp battles._

**Q: What are your plans to build and nourish a stronger and sustainable community?**

_A: Giveaways, contests, quests, and AMA sessions._

**Q: What are your plan for the next first 4 month after the release to avoid significant drop in the token?**

_A: Tokens will need you to upgrade buildings, blend mechanics are made in such a way that most tokens will be needed to reach the maximum levels, at this point we plan to add pvp mode, where tokens will be burned (details will be a little later)._

**Q: The game will be released next to the sale? or is there an estimated date?**

_A: There is no exact date, the main sale is planned for January 12 at 19:00 UTC, after several giveaways among all pack owners - the game will be launched._

**Q: Do you have a telegram channel?**

_A: We will create it a little later, so as not to overburden the work of our moderators. All WarSpace related telegram channels have nothing to do with us, please be careful._

**Q: Will I be able to play your game for free or will I have to buy NFT?**

_A: In order to start playing you need one NFT building._

**Q: Will I need to create many accounts to get more benefits or will it be enough to play from one?**

_A: We came up with smart blending for this - you'll have an incentive to play from the same account, since by improving buildings you'll be able to get more resources._

## **Answers Hyperdrive from the ama-session that were **<mark style="color:red;">**deleted**</mark>**:**

#### DOC of WarSpace: What is the dev teams background will you be doxxing.

An international team that has 10+ years of experience in gaming industry. (mostly mobile) Worked in different companies (BigFish, Joybits, Playrix, Gameloft) and built products with millions of users for iOS and Android. Well you can see it by the level of our art.

We have a lot of experience in game industry, but we must understand that blockchain games are different from classic games with closed economies. So we have to reinvent game economies here. We chose WAX as the first platform to launch because it has the most advanced games and the most advanced users in terms of blockchain games.

We are new to NFT. This is our first project, but the coders have experience in blockchain. Plus we have friends who have been in blockchain for a long time. We are consulting with them. We will roll out the beta later and you will see it for yourselves.

Our citizenship does not allow us to deal with crypto directly. Plus we are new to the topic and from a security point of view we were advised not to open the data. But we have big plans to take over The Space. So we are now working with lawyers on a legal and financial scheme that would allow us to do everything openly. Until we're sure it won't cause problems. The entire team will remain anonymous.

#### Mia Kalphite: How long have you spent developing the game and will it run on unity or is it 2D?

3 months of development. The game is being made on unity, simply because we have a lot of expertise in unity. I have known David Helgason since 2010. The engine is great for web builds. And we have a lot of reusable code and assets. This allowed us to build a product in such a short period of time.

It will be a 2D game and we chose this style of graphics and setting for a reason.

The setting Started from Crypto audience - it's mostly men. Medival is the most popular setting for this demographic.

2D graphics Unfortunately it takes a long time to make high quality 3D graphics. We do not want to promise to make the game. That's why we decided to make 2D graphics. There were still thoughts about pixelart. But there are too many projects in this style on the market. In order to get away from the competition we decided to take the style you see.

When artists have more time we will draw a lot of fan art. Games are about entertainment. And we love it!

#### Pre: What are your plans with BSC?

There are two options here:

* IGO on Binance
* Launching game on their blockchain in their NFT marketplace.

Everything will depend on the perfomance of the game on WAX. We are fully focused on that platform right now.

#### **Gojo-: Are you guys really not staying at wax blockchain only? Why do we need to bridge this game into bsc?**&#x20;

Strategically this is the right move. Attracting new users is one of the most important tasks for any game. Based on the latest GoldmanSuch report, Binance has 55% of the trading volume. Consequently, the new audience that now enters crypto comes through Binance. It's a great place to get new users for games. But you have to understand that we're talking about a completely different scale. At the moment our focus is to become the #1 game on WAX

#### What is your plan to be sustainable in long term? Most new projects lasted for only 1-2 months. Look at Farmer's World.

Yes, this is the biggest challenge for all P2E games.

Jakub Trančík advises switching from Play to Earn > Play and Earn model. But we believe that merge mechanic that will burn a large number of tokens in combination with slowing the progression of generating new resources by the "middle" of the economic cycle, we should see a stopping of the drop in token values. This should happen in about 2-3 months.

Unfortunately no one has run such economic models and it depends heavily on the community itself. In fact, we are creating an open economy which will be community-driven.

In simple words, whales rule the economy of the game.

We believe that maintaining relationships with the whales and creating a comfortable environment for them is the key to our success.

We are seriously planning to take up a significant part of the Play2Earn games market.

#### Galaxy God: How do you plan to market this game?

As Tim from AtomicHub said: "Our banners are the best investment in marketing at WAX"

And it's really true I agree with him.

NFT game marketing is very specific. It's really a challenge because there are no professionals in the market who know how to do it. The industry has just started so we need to test all channels. Influencer marketing is promising.

Our partners have an established relationship with 13,000 gaming youtubers. And we can use this army. But again. First launch the game and test the economy, and then scale.

We also have ideas for a fiat gateway and credit card purchases of game assets. Which could give us new users unfamiliar with crypto. But in order to get those users on board we need to build a very strong community. These users must be welcomed. We'll talk more about that with you guys.

#### ecocapz01: Thanks, you answered my second question. I filled in the form with my frustration. Hoping to get lucky. Hope this game succeeds.

Thank you! Of course it will be a success! We've analyzed a lot of projects - most don't know what games are and don't know how to make them. And what is already on the market looks like non-professional crafts. Our approach is more cool. And as we know the professional approach always leads to success.

And to be honest on the mobile market making games is less fun. We are very happy to have such an active community, finally we can make products for people and communicate with them. That's something we haven't seen in the game industry before.
