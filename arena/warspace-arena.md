**IMPORTANT:** at this point, the team is testing all realtime PVP Battle systems.

**The main purpose of the launch of this mode:** to give users the opportunity to distract from the grind of resources, as well as to test all real time PVP Battle systems before the full release.

**Mechanics:** Users will be offered to take part in a deadly battle against a powerful enemy of the Warspace universe. The number of participants in one battle is unlimited. A generous reward (up to 1,000 WAX!) awaits the winner, the reward will be announced before each battle. In order to enter the boss' domain the player needs to make a deposit to his inner arena account (between 100 and 1,000 WAX). These funds will be used by the player to deal damage to the boss (1 attack = 1 WAX).&#x20;

After the start of the battle, all combatants will have 30 seconds to decide whether to strike the boss or to wait for a more opportune moment. At this point the player has to choose the right strategy, as the winner will be the one who made the last hit to the boss at the end of the time allotted for the strike.
